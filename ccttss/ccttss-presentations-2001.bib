  abstract	= {Component-based environments have had a tremendous impact
		  in recent years in the way software is developed in the
		  business, industrial, and internet-related areas. However
		  "commodity" component models, such as CORBA, COM/DCOM, and
		  JavaBeans are not well suited to the needs of
		  high-performance simulation software, especially on
		  massively parallel computers. The Common Component
		  Architecture began in 1998 as a grass-roots effort to
		  develop a component model targeted to the needs of
		  high-performance computing. It is now the focus of an
		  Integrated Software Infrastructure Center under the DOE
		  SciDAC program with the goal of developing the current
		  draft/prototype stage of specifications and implementations
		  into a production-quality component environment for the
		  scientific computing community.
		  
		  I will introduce ideas from component-based software
		  development, describe the Common Component Architecture,
		  and describe the Center's organization and research program.
		  
		  Following the talk and a short break, there will be an
		  informal demo/tutorial which is open to anyone
		  interested.},
