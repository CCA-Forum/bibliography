  abstract	= {Multiphysics and multiscale simulation systems share a
		  common software requirement-infrastructure to implement
		  data exchanges between their constituent parts-often called
		  the coupling problem. On distributed-memory parallel
		  platforms, the coupling problem is complicated by the need
		  to describe, transfer, and transform distributed data,
		  known as the parallel coupling problem. Parallel coupling
		  is emerging as a new grand challenge in computational
		  science as scientists attempt to build multiscale and
		  multiphysics systems on parallel platforms. An additional
		  coupling problem in these systems is language
		  interoperability between their constituent codes. We have
		  created a multilingual parallel coupling programming model
		  based on a successful open-source parallel coupling
		  library, the Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT). This programming
		  model's capabilities reach beyond MCT's native Fortran
		  implementation to include bindings for the C++ and Python
		  programming languages. We describe the method used to
		  generate the inte rlanguage bindings. This approach enables
		  an object-based programming model for implementing parallel
		  couplings in non-Fortran coupled systems and in systems
		  with language heterogeneity. We describe the C++ and Python
		  versions of the MCT programming model and provide short
		  examples. We report preliminary performance results for the
		  MCT interpolation benchmark. We describe a major Python
		  application that uses the MCT Python bindings, a Python
		  implementation of the control and coupling infrastructure
		  for the community climate system model. We conclude with a
		  discussion of the significance of this work to productivity
		  computing in multidisciplinary computational science.},
